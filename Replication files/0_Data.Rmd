##ACLED DATA
Original (daily) data files can be downloaded from the ACLED website (not included in project folder). 
The code below was used to aggregate the data into a monthly form.
The endpoint merged data used in the model is stored within master_dataset.csv.

Bring in ACLED index data. (Takes 2 mins)
```{r ACLED-merge, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
ACLED <- read_csv("data/ACLED index/ACLED_master.csv")

# merge ACLED sets together (had to be downloaded in segments)
ACLED1 <- read_csv("data/ACLED index/1997-01-01-2001-01-01.csv")
ACLED2 <- read_csv("data/ACLED index/2001-01-01-2011-01-01.csv")
ACLED3 <- read_csv("data/ACLED index/2011-01-01-2017-01-01.csv")
ACLED4 <- read_csv("data/ACLED index/2017-01-01-2018-01-01.csv")
ACLED5 <- read_csv("data/ACLED index/2018-01-01-2019-01-01.csv")

#Check to make sure all observations are unique in the merged set
group_by(ACLED, event_id_cnty) %>%
  summarize(n_id = n()) %>%
  arrange(descending = TRUE)
# true â€” no repeats

write.csv(ACLED, "data/ACLED index/ACLED_master.csv")

##World Bank economic indicator data
World Bank data can be downloaded from their website 
(https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators).
Datasets included in the "All Research Documents (Feb-Sept 2024)" folder.
Many variables never used in resulting model.

Pivot other sets into usable format.
```{r pivot-econ-sets}
WB_businesses <- read.csv("WB_businesses.csv")
WB_businesses <- pivot_longer(data = WB_businesses, cols = 5:67, names_to = "year")
WB_businesses$year <- gsub("^.{0,1}", "", WB_businesses$year)

WB_economic_indicators <- read_excel("WB_economic_indicators.xlsx", .name_repair = "universal") 
WB_economic_indicators <- pivot_longer(data = WB_economic_indicators, cols = 5:67, names_to = "year")
WB_economic_indicators$year <- gsub("^.{0,3}", "", WB_economic_indicators$year)
WB_economic_indicators <- WB_economic_indicators %>%
  mutate(value = as.numeric(value))

WB_airports <- read.csv("airport_volume_airport_locations_WB.csv") %>%
  mutate(year = 2023)
```

Merge into a comprehensive country/year dataset.
```{r merge-econ-sets}

#Because the original ACLED daily data is not included in the replication files, 
#we will import the resulting master_dataset.csv later (which does include 
#ACLED, as generated with the code above).

##Generate percentage change variables (US flight data)
Code to generate the "change in flights" variables is below.
Results will be in percentage change terms (Since they were multiplied by 100).
If the value from the previous year was 0, the change was calculated with a denominator set to .5 (preventing an "Inf" result and producing a result as if the baseline were just .75 of a flight, still showing an increase if 1 singular flight is recorded).

Let's deal with the outliers produced by going from 0 to a high flight number by dropping everything on and before that year. (If it wasn't an extreme result, we keep it, because it still represents an increase from 0. Recall that we set the division by a baseline of 100 to minimize extreme results)
```{r clean_pct}
ggplot(data=changes, mapping = aes(x=year,y=passengers_in_change_pct)) +
  geom_point()

# Identify the first year with passengers_in_change_pct > 2500 for each country
high_increase_years <- changes %>%
  filter(passengers_in_change_pct > 2500) %>%
  group_by(Country.Name) %>%
  summarize(first_high_year = min(year)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(first_high_year)

# Remove all observations for those countries on or before the year of the first high increase
changes <- changes %>%
  left_join(high_increase_years, by = "Country.Name") %>%
  filter(is.na(first_high_year) | year > first_high_year) %>%
  select(-first_high_year)

#Reiterate to catch leftovers

# Identify the first year with passengers_in_change_pct > 2500 for each country
high_increase_years <- changes %>%
  filter(passengers_in_change_pct > 2500) %>%
  group_by(Country.Name) %>%
  summarize(first_high_year = min(year)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%

# Remove all observations for those countries on or before the year of the first high increase
changes <- changes %>%
  left_join(high_increase_years, by = "Country.Name") %>%

# Plot to verify the removal
ggplot(data = changes, mapping = aes(x = year, y = passengers_in_change_pct)) +
  geom_point()

changes <- changes %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = 3:ncol(changes),
               names_to = "Indicator.Name", values_to = "value")
```

Merge with master dataset
```{r merge-flights-master}
master_dataset <- y %>%
  filter(!str_detect(Indicator.Name, "change_pct")) %>%
  full_join(changes, by = c("Country.Name", "year", "Indicator.Name", "value"))

#export new master set
write.csv(master_dataset, "master_dataset2.csv")

##Standardizing country names, timelines, removing duplicates, handling NAs

```

Handling naming difference for Kyrgyzstan
```{r ukraine-fill-in-2023}
#I noticed later that Kyrgyzstan needs standardized names.
data_master <- master_dataset %>%
  mutate(Country.Name = case_when(Country.Name == "Kyrgyz Republic" ~ "Kyrgyzstan",
                                   Country.Name == "Kyrgyzstan" ~ "Kyrgyzstan",
                                   (Country.Name != "Kyrgyzstan" & Country.Name != "Kyrgyz Republic") ~ Country.Name))
```

Remove duplicate observations, which are caused by error in data merging (will fix if time)
```{r duplicates}
# Identify duplicates
duplicate_rows <- data_master %>%
  filter(Indicator.Name %in% c("fatalities_y, Violence against civilians", "fatalities_y, Strategic developments", "fatalities_y, Protests", "fatalities_y, Explosions/Remote violence", "fatalities_y, Battles", "count_events_y, Violence against civilians", "count_events_y, Strategic developments", "count_events_y, Protests", "count_events_y, Explosions/Remote violence", "count_events_y, Battles", "count_events_y, All types of violent conflict", "AirportsVolume", "AirportsCount", "GDP growth (annual %)", "Tax revenue (% of GDP)", "Inflation, GDP deflator (annual %)", "passengers_spike_true", "flights_spike_true", "total_passengers_in", "total_passengers_out", "total_flights_in", "total_flights_out", "total_freight_in", "total_freight_out", "Foreign direct investment, net inflows (% of GDP)"),
         year >= 2000) %>%
  group_by(Country.Name, year, Indicator.Name) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  filter(n > 1)

# View duplicate rows (if any)
print(duplicate_rows)

#Let's just drop the duplicates, plus the errors with Tristan da Cunha and other comma'd territories that got split incorrectly. I will fix these more directly if I have time, but omitting them from the regression just reduces the sample size, which should have a minimal effect on inference.
data_master <- data_master %>%
  filter(!(Country.Name == "Congo, Dem. Rep." & (Indicator.Name == "AirportsCount" | Indicator.Name == "AirportsVolume") & year == 2023))
```

I ended up deciding to cut the inference to pre-COVID (2010-2019), cutting out data measurement issues in the COVID period and as a result of the Russo-Ukraine war. Therefore, I cut much of my processing regarding a lack of 2023 data entries, especially if the code chunk was purely about this issue.

The data is called "scm_data" below since it was originally created for the SCM model, but it is used in later unrelated models too.
```{r specifications}
scm_data <- data_master %>%
  filter(Indicator.Name %in% c("fatalities_y, Violence against civilians", "fatalities_y, Strategic developments", "fatalities_y, Protests", "fatalities_y, Explosions/Remote violence", "fatalities_y, Battles", "count_events_y, Violence against civilians", "count_events_y, Strategic developments", "count_events_y, Protests", "count_events_y, Explosions/Remote violence", "count_events_y, Battles", "count_events_y, All types of violent conflict", "AirportsVolume", "AirportsCount", "GDP growth (annual %)", "Inflation, GDP deflator (annual %)", "passengers_spike_true", "flights_spike_true", "total_passengers_in", "total_passengers_out", "total_flights_in", "total_flights_out", "total_freight_in", "total_freight_out", "Foreign direct investment, net inflows (% of GDP)", "GDP (current US$)", "flights_in_change_pct", "passengers_in_change_pct"),
         year >= 2000, year <= 2019) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Indicator.Name, values_from = value) %>%
  group_by(Country.Name, year) %>%
  summarise_all(~ if (any(!is.na(.))) .[!is.na(.)][1] else NA)
#Note: you can add variables in the filter above and export the resulting dataset in order to add more columns. for instance, add: , "GDP (current US$)", "flights_in_change_pct", "passengers_in_change_pct"
```

We have a problem with NA values. Let's fill in all ACLED and flight-count cases with NA with 0, since if they weren't included, there were no events, counts, fatalities, and so on. 
```{r na}
library(zoo)

#1: ACLED and flight data -> 0 

# Define the variables to impute NAs with 0
variables_to_impute <- c("fatalities_y, Violence against civilians", "fatalities_y, Strategic developments", 
                         "fatalities_y, Protests", "fatalities_y, Explosions/Remote violence", "fatalities_y, Battles", 
                         "count_events_y, Violence against civilians", "count_events_y, Strategic developments", 
                         "count_events_y, Protests", "count_events_y, Explosions/Remote violence", "count_events_y, Battles", 
                         "count_events_y, All types of violent conflict",
                         "total_passengers_in", "total_passengers_out", "total_flights_in", "total_flights_out", 
                         "total_freight_in", "total_freight_out")

# Impute NAs with 0 for the specified variables
scm_data_imputed <- scm_data %>%
  mutate_at(vars(all_of(variables_to_impute)), ~ifelse(is.na(.), 0, .))

# Filter the dataset to find NAs in the specified variables
scm_data_imputed %>%
  filter(if_any(all_of(variables_to_impute), is.na))
#Success!


#some rows still have NAs. It seems like they are small countries or incorrectly named countries. Let's just drop them for simplicity.
scm_data_imputed <- na.omit(scm_data_imputed)
```

To know the earliest year of data for each country, let's generate a dataframe.
```{r na-obs}
min_years_per_country <- scm_data_imputed %>%
  group_by(Country.Name) %>%
  summarize(min_year = min(year))
```

It will return an error if there are spaces in the columns. Let's fix that.
```{r col-fill}
colnames(scm_data_imputed) <- gsub(" ", "_", colnames(scm_data_imputed))
colnames(scm_data_imputed) <- gsub("%", "pct", colnames(scm_data_imputed))
colnames(scm_data_imputed) <- gsub("\\(|\\)", "", colnames(scm_data_imputed))
colnames(scm_data_imputed) <- gsub(",", "", colnames(scm_data_imputed))
```

```{r export-data}
colnames(scm_data_imputed) <- gsub("_", ".", colnames(scm_data_imputed))
write.csv(scm_data_imputed, "scm_data2.csv")
```

Create some logged variables:
```{r vars, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
data <- data %>% 
  mutate(total_FDI_n = (Foreign.direct.investment.net.inflows.pct.of.GDP * `GDP.current.US$` / 100),
         total_FDI_r = (Foreign.direct.investment.net.inflows.pct.of.GDP * `GDP, PPP (constant 2017 international $)` / 100),
    log_FDI_n = log1p(total_FDI_n),
    log_FDI_r = log1p(total_FDI_r),
    ihs_FDI_n = asinh(total_FDI_n),
    ihs_FDI_r = asinh(total_FDI_r),
    log_GDP_n = log1p(`GDP.current.US$`),
    log_GDP_r = log1p(`GDP, PPP (constant 2017 international $)`),
    log_GDP_r_pc = log1p(`GDP per capita, PPP (constant 2017 international $)`),
    log_battle = log1p(fatalities.y.Battles))
```

We can switch between the two nominal GDP measures by trading total_GDP_n_ID for `GDP.current.US$` (and vice versa).

Guide to new variables:
total_FDI_n = nominal total FDI (using GDP in constant 2017 international$, which was calculated using GDP deflator from PPP measures)
total_FDI_r = real total FDI (from PPP GDP numbers in current $US)
log_FDI_n = nominal total FDI, with log+1 transformation
log_FDI_r = real total FDI, with log+1 transformation
ihs_FDI_n = nominal total FDI, with IHS transformation
ihs_FDI_r = real total FDI, with IHS transformation
log_GDP_n = nominal GDP, logged+1
log_GDP_r = real GDP, logged+1
log_GDP_r_pc = real GDP per capita, logged+1
log_battle = battle fatalities, logged+1
